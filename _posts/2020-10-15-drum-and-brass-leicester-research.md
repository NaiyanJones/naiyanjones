Who? Where?

[Drum and Brass](http://drumandbrass.co.uk/) are a community group producing two podcasts funded by Leicester City Council and National Lottery Fund to increase the health and wellbeing of the elderly in care homes. I am researching and writing content on the positive effect of music on elderly people’s health and wellbeing for the podcast and also recording outcomes and evidence for the funder’s impact assessments.

What I did?

Outcome?

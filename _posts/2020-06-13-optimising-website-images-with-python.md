title: Optimising website images with Python
---
Previously I had downloaded all the images from my Medium posts with [medium-2-md](https://www.gautamdhameja.com/medium-to-markdown-converter/) and then added custom images to this website. I then plugged my site into Google's [Page Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) to see how my website was fairing.

Desktop speed was looking good.

Mobile.... not so good.

So off I went to find a way to optimise all my images, which led me to [optimize-images](https://pypi.org/project/optimize-images/) written in Python. I'm a simple man and so was the module. I ran it through the command line and selected my folder full of images I had got off Medium.

To install:

`pip3 install pillow optimize-images`

Choose folder path filling in the blanks afetr ./:

`optimize-images ./`

After that I re-uploaded my now optimised images to GitHub. As you can see the results were pretty good for desktop.

And brilliant for mobile!

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Hi, Iâ€™m Naiyan. Or as most people call me, Nay.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>I am an independent researcher and a data analyst at the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). My research interests include social media platforms, online communities and political communications. I have a specific interest in the social media platform Reddit.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Currently I am collaborating internationally with several American academics on research projects involving Reddit. And also building my data science skills, particularly with machine learning and natural language processing</P>

    title: "Reddit literature review and ethics project"
    excerpt: "Building off my previous experience I am now part of a multipart project on Reddit involving a systematic literature review and how researchers discuss ethics when using Reddit data. The literature review includes bibliographic details, study keywords, research topic, subreddits studied, whether the study was primarily about Reddit, a description of the data used, the method of data capture, type of analysis, and an overview of how ethics are discussed.

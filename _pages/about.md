Hi, I'm Naiyan. Or as most people call me, Nay.

I am a social researcher with a postgraduate diploma from the University of Birmingham. Trained in both qualitative and quantitative research methods. My specalisms are based in social media, government studies and public policy. I have worked with charities, community groups, co-operatives and briefly in politics.

I am collaborating internationally with several American academics to co-author papers on the social media platform Reddit including a literature review, ethical data use in research and a meta-analysis. I also have a keen interest in building my skills on machine learning, particularly with natural language processing.

If you're interested in more check out my [current projects](/_pages/projects) and [blog posts](/categories/) covering older projects.

*For businesses*: I am currently looking for opportunities. If you're looking to fill any researcher, digital communications, policy or UX design positions then check my [hire](/_pages/hire-me/) page for an outline of my skills and experience.

*For researchers*: I am happy to [chat](/_pages/contact/) about my research and answer queries. I enjoy collaborating with other researchers particularly on from different disciplinary backgrounds. At the moment I am open to small sized collaborations.

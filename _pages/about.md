Hi, I'm Naiyan. Or as most people call me, Nay.

I am an independent researcher and a data analyst at the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). My research interests include social media platforms, online communities and political communications. I have a specific interest in the social media platform Reddit.

I have worked with charities, community groups, co-operatives and briefly in politics. Recently I graduated with a postgraduate qualification in social research from the University of Birmingham, UK.

Currently I am collaborating internationally with several American academics to co-author papers on the social media platform Reddit including a literature review, ethical data use in research and a meta-analysis. I also have a keen interest in building my skills on machine learning, particularly with natural language processing.

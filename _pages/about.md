Hi, I'm Naiyan. Or as most people call me, Nay.

I am a social researcher with a postgraduate diploma from the University of Birmingham. Trained in both qualitative and quantitative research methods. My specalisms are based in social media, government studies and public policy. I have worked with charities, community groups, co-operatives and briefly in politics.

My current research interest is on the social media website Reddit and learning a variety of programming languages including Python, R and Jekyll. You can read more about using Jekyll to make this website [here](https://naiyanjones.github.io/personal/how-i-built-this-website/)!

In need of my skill set or looking for someone like me? Then check out my [hire](/_pages/hire-me/) page and let's [chat](/_pages/contact/).

Hi, I'm Naiyan. Or as most people call me, Nay.

I am a social researcher with a postgraduate diploma from the University of Birmingham. I am trained in both qualitative and quantative research methods. My specalisms are based in social media, government studies and public policy. I have experience working with charities, community groups, co-operatives and social work. 

My current research interest is on the social media website Reddit and learning to code. That includes this website!

In need of my skill set or looking for someone like me? Then check out my [hire](/_pages/hire-me.md) page and let's [chat](mailto:naiyan@hotmail.co.uk).

Hi, I'm Naiyan. Or as most people call me, Nay.

I am a qualified independent social researcher with a postgradate diploma from the University of Birmingham, UK. I am trained in both qualitative and quantative research methods, with advanced training in case study, questionnaire and mixed method designs. My specalisms are in social media, government studies and public policy. With experience working in the third-sector, co-operatives and social work. 

My current research interest is on the social media website Reddit and expanding my skillset with Python and R.

When I'm not working I'm probably either at home attmepting some DIY or outside hiking.

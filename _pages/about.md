Hi, I'm Naiyan. Or as most people call me, Nay.

I am a social researcher from the University of Birmingham trained in both qualitative and quantitative research methods. My specalisms are based in social media, government studies and public policy. I have worked with charities, community groups, co-operatives and briefly in politics.

I am collaborating internationally with several American academics to co-author papers on the social media platform Reddit including a literature review, ethical data use in research and a meta-analysis. I also have a keen interest in building my skills on machine learning, particularly with natural language processing.

If you're interested in more check out my [current projects](/projects) and [blog posts](/categories/) covering older topics.

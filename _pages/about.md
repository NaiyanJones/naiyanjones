Hi, I'm Naiyan. Or as most people call me, Nay.

I am a social researcher with a postgraduate diploma from the University of Birmingham. Trained in both qualitative and quantitative research methods. My specalisms are based in social media, government studies and public policy. I have worked with charities, community groups, co-operatives and briefly in politics.

I am collaborating internationally with several American academics to co-author papers on the social media platform Reddit and ethical use of social media data in research. I also have a keen interest in building my skills with machine learning, particularly with natural language processing.

To read more in-depth about my current projects [see here](/_pages/projects/) and older work and blog posts [see here](/_pages/categories/).

*For businesses*: I am currently looking for opportunities. If you're looking to fill any researcher, digital communications, policy or UX design positions then check my [hire](/_pages/hire-me/) page for an outline of my skills and experience.

*For researchers*: I am happy to chat about my research and answer queries. I'm open to small sized collaborations at the moment and very much enjoy inter-disciplinary research. You can [contact me here](/_pages/contact/).

Hi, I'm Naiyan. Or as most people call me, Nay.

Cupidatat ea do et in excepteur in. Ad nostrud ut est esse eu duis ea sunt eiusmod. Aliquip tempor veniam sint elit fugiat. Velit incididunt laboris amet incididunt labore dolore irure velit excepteur commodo deserunt laborum. Consectetur eu fugiat veniam veniam Lorem labore magna eiusmod. Ea occaecat reprehenderit pariatur consectetur minim labore ut aliquip.	I am a qualified independent social researcher with a postgradate diploma from the University of Birmingham, UK. I am trained in both qualitative and quantative research methods with advanced training in case study, questionnaire and mixed method designs. My specalisms are in social media, government and policy.

My current research focus is on the social media website Reddit and expanding my skillset with Python, R and Jekyll (which is what this website is built with!).

When I stop trying to be serious I'm mainly being a dork with my hobbies.
